# Contributing to Yocto

Code contributions, such as features, bug fixes and tests, and documentation are all welcomed.

If you would like to make a contribution, please look at the issue tracker and open a new issue if there is not already one which is addressed by your contribution.

# Code contributions

Following the "fork-and-pull" workflow:
1. Fork the Yocto repository
2. Clone the forked repository and add the upstream repository [ejthomas/yocto](https://github.com/ejthomas/yocto) as a remote
3. Develop your contribution in a feature branch of your fork, making sure to merge the default branch of the upstream repository regularly to include any new changes
4. Open a pull request comparing the feature branch of your fork to the default branch of the upstream repository as base

Thank you for your contributions!
