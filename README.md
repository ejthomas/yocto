# Installation

Yocto is designed for deployment on the web, but until it is released you can try out the latest build by running it in a Docker container locally.

After cloning the repository and [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), the easiest way to try the app is to use Docker Compose.

```
cd yocto
docker compose up -d
```

# Usage

When the containers are runnign, Yocto is available at http://localhost:8080.
